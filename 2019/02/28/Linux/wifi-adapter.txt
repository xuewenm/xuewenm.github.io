https://askubuntu.com/questions/1067286/still-no-wifi-adapter-for-realtek-rtl8822be-found-in-18-04


I was having the same issue on a Lenovo Legion Y530 laptop, which has a Realtek rtl8822be wireless network card, with 18.10 Ubuntu Mate. What I did to fix it was, plugging it into the network via ethernet, I ran sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrage then, using your favorite text editor edit blacklist.conf

sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

I added the line:

blacklist ideapad_laptop

then saved and closed the file, and rebooted.

if you didnt want to make this change, without testing it, you could do this:

sudo rmmod ideapad_laptop

doing this, gave me instant results. wireless networks appeared, I was able to connect, and life was great again. I have no idea if your setup will have an ideapad module, but you might try it. Alternatively, you might have an HP module that needs blocking to enable this device.
